==========================================
Sampling states from the SEI-SLR algorithm
==========================================
The example runs the SEI-SLR algorithm to generate states uniformly distributed on the selection event.

By running over the~$2^{10}$ possible vectors :math:`Y \in \{ 0,1\}^n`, we have previously computed exactly the selection event.
In the following, we identify each vector :math:`Y \in \{0, 1\}^N` with the number between~$0$ and~$2^N-1=1024$ that it represents in the base-2 numeral system.
The following figure shows the last :math:`500,000` visited states for our simulated annealing path. On the vertical axis, we have the integers encoded by all possible vectors :math:`Y \in \{0,1\}^N`. 
The red dashed lines represent the states that belong to the selection event :math:`E_M`. While crosses are showing the visited states on the last :math:`500,000` time steps of the path, green crosses are emphasizing the ones that belong to the selection event.

The following figure shows that the SEI-SLR algorithm covers properly the selection event without being stuck in one specific state of :math:`E_{M}`. 
The simulated annealing path is jumping from one state of :math:`E_{M}` to another, ending up with an asymptotic distribution of the visited states that approximates the uniform distribution on :math:`E_{M}`.
